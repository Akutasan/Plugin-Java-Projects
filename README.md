All my projects and their descriptions are displayed below:

## Friends Plugin with Friends GUI
This is the BungeeCord Friends Plugin + Spigot GUI that I made for a server.  
It was still a WIP and when the server shutdown I stopped working on it.  
Altough the Project is about 95% done and all that's left is to complete the GUI and fix some MySQL bugs.

## Lobby Scoreboard
This is a Spigot plugin for a Scoreboard for a server which combined the rank, rank time, coins and onlinetime in one.  
The project is 100% done.

## Party Plugin
This is a BungeeCord plugin for a server which is similar to the Hypixel Party plugin.  
It is very simple and requires 0 setup and is 100% done.

## Report Plugin
This a BungeeCord plugin for reporting players on Hacking etc.  
The report reasons are configurable in the config.yml and you can log-in/log-out to receive reports.
This plugin is 100% done, altough it needs some refining.

## Team SkyBlock
This is a very sipmle Spigot plugin for randomizing ores created from Cobblestone generators.
I included this since I really like the simplcity of this plugin.
THis plugin is 100% done.
